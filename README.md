# JS-PasswordGenerator


## Description


This repo is created for module 5 Challenge, in this challenge I was using <b>JavaScript</b> and I was working with provided HTML tempate to create password generator.
I wrote JavaScript code that generates a password when the button is clicked and presents a series of prompts for password criteria:
<ul>
<li>Length of password

<li>At least 10 characters but no more than 64

<li>Character types

<li>Lowercase

<li>Uppercase

<li>Numeric

<li>Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

<li>Code validates each input and at least one character type should be selected

<li>Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in written to the page.

</ul>
